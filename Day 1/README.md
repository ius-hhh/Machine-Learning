# 🌸 Day 1 - Iris Flower Classification

This is the first project in the **"30 Days, 30 Machine Learning Projects"** challenge. In this beginner-friendly project, we built a machine learning model that can classify **Iris flowers** into one of three species based on measurements of their petals and sepals.

## 📌 Project Objective

To classify Iris flowers into:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

using their:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Environment Setup** using virtualenv  
2. **Loaded the Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
4. **Split data** into training and test sets
5. **Trained a Logistic Regression model**
6. **Evaluated** accuracy and visualized the confusion matrix
